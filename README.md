# Ayy Lmao Long War Of the EdgeLords Ediszyn

# What the fuck is this?

This is a continuation of a joke mod found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1125601165&searchtext=ayy+lmao):

I have recieved permission from the author to continue, and expand the "project".

Currently, the main goal is to fully integrate it  with the Long war of the Chosen Mod found [here](https://github.com/long-war-2/lwotc).

Note: THE MAIN DEVS HAVE NOTHING TO WITH THIS. I TAKE ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ABOMINATION.

# Current state

Not even close to ready. Some enemies are missing, tons of unupdated text, however the bare minimum is there.

# Job list
* Figure out the names for the rest of the enemies. The ones left are:
       
  * ADVENT commmando   

  

* "Translate" more skills. I already figured out how to make abilities throw out LocFlyoverText instead of LocalFriendlyName, so the only thing remaining is doing exactly that.

* If I'm feeling ambitious, "translate" some of the spoken subtitles.


# Contributions

If you thought of something funny, make a pull request. I already have taken suggestions from others.

# Download
Most up to date downloads are on the discord server, I'll release the thing on the workshop soon-ish
